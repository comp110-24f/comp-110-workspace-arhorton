# was not quite sure how to name the function and define it at the same time
def tea_bags()
    """Multiply two numbers together - 2 and the number of guests."""
from operator import mul
mul("people": int, num1: int) -> int
# why is it saying num1 is undefined - it was working earlier?
# defined the function, importated multiplication, but now i'm struggling to get the function defined as i want
# why doesn't it like the return function? worked well in class
